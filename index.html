    <h1> Welcome to my website! </h1>
    <p>
      I know it doesn't look like much yet, but it will soon!

    <h2> Introduction: </h2> 
    <p>
      So, a little about myself: 
    <ul type='circle'>
      <li> I like to play video games </li>
      <li> I have a dog </li> 
      <li> I am excited to learn how to code </li> 
      <li> I don't know if I should have done any of this yet </li> 
    </ul> 
    </p>
    <div>
      I have no idea how to code, and I'm really hoping to get some expierience out of this program. This program has been pretty awesome so far!(<em>especially</em> the <u><b>pizza</b></u>)
      <br />
    </div>
    <p>
      The main things I would like to get out of this pogram are:
      <ol type='1'>
        <li>The ability to write decent HTML</li>
        <li>The ablitity to write CSS I guess</li>
        <li>The ability to write Javascript maybe</li>
        <li>And finally the ability to have pizza almost every Tuesday</li>
      </ol> 
      I wrote everything in here in about 35 lines so far.
     <ul> 
      <li style='font-size:12px'> Everything on this site so far has been information from <a href='bdpastl.github.io'>BDPA</a>
     </ul>
