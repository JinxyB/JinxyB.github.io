      <h1><strong>This is the <i>very</i> Important and <u> Official </u> Website of Sriram</strong></h1>
    <p>
      I know it doesn't have many memes yet, nor does it look good, but it will.
    </p>

    <h2> Introduction: </h2> 
    <p>
      So, a little about myself:
    <ul type='circle'>
      <li> I like to play video games </li>
      <li> I have a dog </li> 
      <li> I am excited to learn how to code </li>  
    </ul> 
    </p>
    <div>
      I have no idea how to code, (yet) and I'm really hoping to get some expierience out of this program.
      <br /> 
      This program has been pretty awesome so far!(<em>especially</em> the <u><b>pizza</b></u>)
      <br />
      Also, Jacob and I like memes, so here's one right now:
      <br />
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Js-XbNj6Tk?start=36" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    <p> 
      When you see an OEM titan on the other team (only Destiny 2 players will understand) 
      <br />
      When you forget to save your stuff in an editing software
      <br />
      When you see your dog lift it's leg over a carpet
      <br />
      When you get friendzoned
      <br />
      When you make your website a bunch of memes
      <br />
      When no one finds this funny
      <br />
     When you have to take the Math Final
    </p> 
    <p>
      The main things I would like to get out of this program are:
      <ol type='1'>
        <li>The ability to write decent HTML</li>
        <li>The ablitity to write CSS I guess</li>
        <li>The ability to write Javascript maybe</li>
      </ol> 
      I wrote everything in here in about 78 lines so far. I'm sort of proud of myself.
      <br /> 
      Most of you (if you see this) are like "well, this dude's a nerd" 
     <ul> 
      <li style='font-size:12px'> Everything on this site so far has been information from 
        <a class="btn btn-default btn-xs" href="https://bdpastl.github.io" role="button">BDPA's Website</a></li> 
     </ul>
      <br />
         <img 
src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1061/1924/products/Smiling_Face_Emoji_grande.png?v=1480481056" height="200" width="200"  />
      <br />
      I think this next one summarizes how Matt (or Mr. Lane) feels about web development. 
      <br />
         <img

  <br />
Now, for some <b>memes</b>
  <br />

  <br />
  that last one is what I felt as I created this website, and the smashing of the computer was what I <i>wanted</i> to do sometimes.
  <br /> 
  Please forgive the amount of memes my friend Jacob is pouring into his website, and I apologize for all the memes I put in <em>my</em> website. 
  <br /> 
  So, I'm gonna talk a bit more about myself so you can get some background on me. 
  <br />
  Feel free to skip this part if it bores you, which it probably will.
  <ul>
    <li>My dogs name is JInx, and Jinxy is here nickname (my website name)</li>
    <li>I don't fully understand everything we have learned so far, but I <i>do</i> understand HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>I should probably add more Javascript and CSS onto this website so at least it <i>looks</i> like I know what I'm doing</li>
  </ul>
  <br /> 
  As I was creating this website, I tried to get on Github and Slack at school. I can get on Github and Slack, but can't go to my website...<b> Logic <u>100</u></b>
  <br />
  Hope everyone that stayed on this website long enough to get to the bottom has a nice day!
