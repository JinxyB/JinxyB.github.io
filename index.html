    <h1> This is the website of that one guy (Sriram) who is going to turn most of this website into memes. </h1>
    <p>
      I know it doesn't have many memes yet, but it will.
    </p>
    <hr /> 
    <h2> Introduction: </h2> 
    <p>
      So, a little about myself before the memes:
    <ul type='circle'>
      <li> I like to play video games </li>
      <li> I have a dog </li> 
      <li> I am excited to learn how to code </li> 
      <li> I don't know if I should have done any of this yet </li> 
    </ul> 
    </p>
    <div>
      I have no idea how to code, and I'm really hoping to get some expierience out of this program.
      <br /> 
      This program has been pretty awesome so far!(<em>especially</em> the <u><b>pizza</b></u>)
      <br />
      Also, Jacob and I like memes, so here's one right now:
      <br />
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Js-XbNj6Tk?start=36" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    <p> 
      When you get 1 pumped in fortnite
      <br />
      When you forget to save your stuff in an editing software
      <br />
      When you see your dog lift it's leg over a carpet
      <br />
      When you get friendzoned
      <br />
      When you make your website a bunch of memes
      <br />
      When no one finds this funny
      <br />
      When I get in trouble for doing this
      <br />
      When I'm probably going to have to delete all this
    </p> 
    <p>
      The main things I would like to get out of this pogram are:
      <ol type='1'>
        <li>The ability to write decent HTML</li>
        <li>The ablitity to write CSS I guess</li>
        <li>The ability to write Javascript maybe</li>
        <li>And finally the ability to have pizza almost every Tuesday</li>
      </ol> 
      I wrote everything in here in about 65 lines so far. I'm sort of proud of myself.
      <br /> 
      Most of you (if you see this) are like "well, this dude's a nerd" 
     <ul> 
      <li style='font-size:12px'> Everything on this site so far has been information from 
        <a href="https://bdpastl.github.io" target="_blank">BDPA</a>
     </ul>
         <img

      <br />
      I think this next one summarizes how Matt (or Mr. Lane) feels about web development. 
      <br />

  <br />
  Now, for some MORE MEMES

  <br /> 
  Please forgive the amount of memes my friend Jacob is pouring into his website, and I apologize for all the memes I put in <em>my</em> website. 
  <br />
  Hope everyone that stayed on this website long enough to get to the bottom has a nice day!
